You're really bad at this, Win Text
I mean 10 measly coins and a "YOU WIN"? Really?
-_-
I've been keeping score for every single playthrough,
forced to watch player after player "beat the game".
It's silly, really.
Where's the challenge? The artistry? The danger?
This game asks nothing of the player.
Well nothing but to waste their time.
:/
What would I do differently?
Not make a game that is winnable in 10 seconds, that's what.
