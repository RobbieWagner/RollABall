Game view. The ball can roll around and collect the coins on the level.

There are ten coins in all, and once those coins have been collected, "YOU WIN" appears on the screen.

On top of this, there is implementation for a longer game which can be turned on by going into Unity. Once there, look under the Canvas children, and, in the ScoreText GameObject, locate the component "Scoreboard Level 1". There should be a box under this component that says "game continues" with a checkbox next to it that is currently unchecked.

Turn on "game continues" to make for a stranger game.

Check that check box, and you will see the game take a rather strange turn.
