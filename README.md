# RollABall
RollABall Unity game created by following an online Unity tutorial, with added custom models created in Blender. This game uses the Unity Physics engine. In this game, you roll a ball around to collect coins, avoiding the hazards in the way.

Game view. The ball can roll around and collect the coins on the level.


On top of this, there is implementation for a longer game which can be turned on by going into Unity (This doesn't currently work properly and will be fixed in the next patch, if there is one) Once there, look under the Canvas children, and, in the ScoreText GameObject, locate the component "Scoreboard Level 1". There should be a box under this component that says "game continues" with a checkbox next to it that is currently unchecked.

Turn on "game continues" to make for a stranger game.

Check that check box, and you will see the game take a rather strange turn.

The following models were all added, made in Blender:
